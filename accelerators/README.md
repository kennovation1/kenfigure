This directory contains sub-directories for each Benchling Scientific Accelerator
that has been converted into Kenfigure format. Please raise a GitHub issue if
there is a Benchling Accelerator that you'd like to see in Kenfigure format and
is not currently included here.

Here is the listing of all [Benchling Scientific Accelerators](https://community.benchling.com/scientific-accelerators-59).

A README file in each directory will indicate if the files are raw
exports into Kenfigure or have been modified in any way.

Each directory will also contain a raw conversion into an ER Diagram
(in interactive HTML format and DbSchema format).
The initial ER diagrams use an auto-layout algorithm that's usually
very good, but not the same as a human's semantic layout.
Some accelerators have an addition ER diagram that does have a
human guided layout.

Many thanks to Benchling for providing the access required to generate
these Kenfigure versions of the accelerators.
