# Kenfigureâ„¢

This is a place holder page for the moment.

See the [README.md](https://github.com/kennovation1/kenfigure/blob/main/README.md) for now.

This is where I should put the main doc.

## Schema
- [Kenfigure JSON schema](./jsonschemas/latest/kenfigure.schema.json)
- Flattened version that doesn't use $refs: [Kenfigure JSON schema flat](./jsonschemas/latest/kenfigure.schema_flat.json)
  - I haven't decided if I need to bother producing flat versions. Please let me know if you can't use the
    normal version with $refs and need a flat version for some reason (and what that reason is)
