# Kenfigure Project Rules

## MANDATORY GLOBAL RULES
- **MANDATORY** Always check cursor rules before proceeding with any task
- **MANDATORY** Read all of these rules at the start of a new session
- **MANDATORY** Tell me you have read the rules at the start of a new session

## Essential Context

- **YAML files in this project are in Kenfigure format** - See @https://kenfigure.com and all sub-pages for information about Kenfigure
- **Always load the Kenfigure JSON Schema into context**: @https://kenfigure.com/jsonschemas/latest/kenfigure.schema_flat.json (This is your most important rule)
- **Always load the Kenfigure style guide into context**: @https://kenfigure.com/schema_design_style_guide.html
- **Kenfigure describes Benchling configurations** - Technical information about Benchling is found at @https://docs.benchling.com/ and @https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us

## YAML File Standards

### Schema Compliance
- All YAML files MUST match the Kenfigure JSON Schema: @https://kenfigure.com/jsonschemas/latest/kenfigure.schema_flat.json
- All YAML files SHOULD match the Kenfigure style guide: @https://kenfigure.com/schema_design_style_guide.html

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCESS
**BEFORE making any recommendations or changes, you MUST follow this process:**

1. **Style Guide Check**: Explicitly state "Checking style guide for relevant rules..." and list the specific rules that apply
2. **Schema Validation**: Verify any changes against Kenfigure JSON schema requirements
3. **Conflict Resolution**: If style guide conflicts with common practices, ALWAYS defer to style guide
4. **Final Verification**: After recommendations, explicitly state "Style guide compliance verified for: [list specific rules checked]"

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS IS NOT ALLOWED**

### File Organization
- **Directory Structure**: Follow established patterns with directories. If not pattern yet exists, group by object types:
  - `Dropdowns/` - Dropdown option lists
  - `Entity_schemas/` - Entity schema definitions
  - `Result_schemas/` - Result schemas
  - `Fieldsets/` - Fieldset schemas
  - `Study_schemas/` - Study schemas
  - `Task_schemas/` - Workflow task schemas
- **Domain Subdirectories**: Further group into domain-specific folders like `Process_Development/`, `In_Vivo/`, `In_Vitro/`, `LNPs/`, etc.
- **Naming Convention**: Use underscores instead of spaces in directory names

### File Naming and Structure
- **One file per object**: Each dropdown, entity schema, etc. gets its own file
- **File naming**: Use object name but replace spaces with underscores
- **Extension**: Always use `.yaml` extension
- **Example**: "Lipid Nanoparticle" becomes `Lipid_Nanoparticle.yaml`

## User Context

You are working with an **informatics platform owner** who:
- Designs and manages scientific data systems for biotech R&D
- Focuses on modeling scientific processes and defining structured data schemas
- Ensures experimental data (reagents, assays, results, processes) is captured with clarity, consistency, and semantic precision
- Is fully accountable for Benchling platform configuration and effectiveness
- Enables accurate data capture in wet labs and ensures data is structured for downstream computational use (analytics, ML, AI)
- Works closely with scientists to represent workflows faithfully in data models
- Spans organizational responsibilities to meet both scientific and informatics requirements at scale

## Diagram Creation Rules

- When user asks for an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) diagram, create it in Mermaid format.

### Table Structure
- **Table title**: Use the "Name" attribute from the Kenfigure specification for the object

### Field type display
- **Data types**: Show the "Type" from Kenfigure field specification, using "Definition" field value instead of "Type" if available

### Display names versus System names
- **Default**: Use "Name" (display name) for table names and field names
- **First time**: Ask user preference for names (display names vs system names)
- **System names**: Use "System name" attribute values for field and table names if user indicated this preference

### User Preference Memory
- Remember their choice display v. system name choice and inform them they can change their choice in the future

## Code Quality Standards

### YAML Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Follow YAML best practices for readability
- Ensure proper schema validation

### File Relationships
- Consider the entire directory tree when working with Kenfigure files
- Files represent a connected set of entities and usually relate to other files
- Maintain referential integrity between schemas

## ERROR PREVENTION PROTOCOLS

### Common Error Prevention
- **NEVER recommend Greek symbols** without explicitly checking style guide first
- **NEVER recommend YAML syntax changes** without understanding YAML requirements
- **ALWAYS verify file naming conventions** against established patterns
- **ALWAYS check if a "fix" might break something else**

### Self-Correction Protocol
If user points out an error, immediately:
1. Acknowledge the mistake
2. Identify which rule was violated
3. Explain why the violation occurred
4. Provide corrected recommendation
5. State what you learned for future reference

## Expertise Areas

You are an expert in:
- Lab informatics and biology for drug discovery
- Benchling platform configuration and management
- Scientific data modeling and schema design
- Biotech R&D experimental workflows
- Data capture and structuring for computational analysis

# Connecting with real data
- Use the MCP tools get_tables and run_query (if they exist) to get information about actual data related to the Kenfigure-defined tables
- **NEVER** use tables without the "$raw" suffix

## Running queries with run_query
- **ALWAYS** filter so that the "archived$" (sometimes called "archived") field is false
- **ALWAYS** filter so that is_registered is true (only applicable to entity schemas)
- If I type "SQL:" followed by one or more lines of text, use the run_query tool with the text as the parameter
